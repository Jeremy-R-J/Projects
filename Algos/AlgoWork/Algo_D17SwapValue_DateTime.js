    Given two vars, x and y that store integers, swap their values WITHOUT
    creating any new variables or using any data types.
    Don't worry about creating a function either.
    No destructuring

    Time in Words
    Write a function that accepts 2 numbers, hour and minute, for hour of the day and minutes of the hour,
    and return a string of the time. Follow these patterns:
                5:00 --> five o' clock
                5:01 --> one minute past five
                5:10 --> ten minutes past five
                5:15 --> quarter past five
                5:30 --> half past five
                5:40 --> twenty minutes to six
                5:45 --> quarter to six
                5:47 --> thirteen minutes to six
                5:28 --> twenty eight minutes past five

    EXAMPLE:
    let h = 5;
    let m = 47;

    timeInWords(h, m) should return "thirteen minutes to six"

function timeInWords(hour, minute){
    //if statement for 30 
    //if statement for 15
    //if statement for 45
    //if statement for all other times
